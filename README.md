Tight Rope Wrist
===========

Created originally as a fun game that also trains one's sense of
balance (or at least wrist handling) some time in November of 2014.
Disc calculation code borrowed from Pebble feature_accel_discs.c 
example project.

For practical applications, this app could be the start of using smartwear
for therapy, particularly balancing/motor skill therapy.  The watch could
act as a sensor for walking troubles or changes in gait.
